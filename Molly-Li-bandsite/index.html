                - Lead vocalist of The Bees Knees</h2>
            <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
            <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San 
                Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic lineup
                featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, 
                a keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first 
                commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention 
                from their future manager. Having extensive experience 
                working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was 
                confident the band could succeed even further with more 
                support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known
                record label.</p>

            <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining international 
                recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts.
                New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of 
                the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. 
                Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are
                drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. 
                The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio 
                album, looking to be released in early 2024.</p>
